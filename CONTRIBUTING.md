## Commit messages

Everyone must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) convention.

Yes it's opinionated, yes it's strict, but that's how we all understand each other.

Whenever you add a meaningful change (i.e. not a deps bump), write a line in the `CHANGELOG.md` for the upcoming release.
